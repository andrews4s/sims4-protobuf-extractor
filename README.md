# Sims 4 Protobuf Extractor
A simple cheat code to extract the .proto files from The Sims 4. 

## Usage
1. Install script in your mods folder.
2. Start The Sims 4.
3. In Live mode, open the cheat console and enter the cheat code "proto".

A folder on your Desktop will be created with all of the game's Protobuf schemas in it.
